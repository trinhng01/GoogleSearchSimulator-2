# GoogleSearchSimulator v2

Google's search engine is a powerful tool and I want to create a simulator Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP).

## Update from v1:

1. For each search keyword/term, display only the top 10 priority search result items/links based on the PageRank using Quicksort algorithm instead of using Heapsort.

2. Based on scores of 30 URLs, use Binary Search Tree to manipulate the data.

3. To speed up the search result, Google search engine dynamically collects a list of top N popular keywords. Use Bucket Sort to implement that idea of sorting companyâ€™s names of URLs in alphabetical order.

## What I Learned
- [x] Implemented Binary Search Tree
- [x] Implemented Quick sort
- [x] Implemented Bucker sort

## Plan for GoogleSearchSimulator v3
* Improve the performance of the application using Red-Black Tree
* Add new features to the app (search, delete, insert)
